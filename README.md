A small and light software to monitor each  interfaceâ€˜s traffic on your computer. The OS must be Linux. 
Maybe other OS can do this (for example Mac) by just changing one line of the code.
**It doesn't need graphic interface**

It can be used for displaying each interface's traffic in your computer. For example each interface's in packet, out packet, in rate and out rate. Its unit is kbits/sec.

Comparing to iptraf, it can dispaly all interface on your computer including virtual network interface which iptraf can not. And it can also dynamic display the interface which is brought up or down.

It has much space to improve. Once I have time, I will continue add function to it.

It runs something like this.
